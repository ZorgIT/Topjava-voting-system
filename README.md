[Project TopJava-28](https://javaops.ru/view/topjava2)
===============================

- The source code was taken from the TopJava migration to Spring Boot (without food)
- Based on this repository, the "Restaurant Voting" final project was developed.

-------------------------------------------------------------

- Stack: [JDK 17](http://jdk.java.net/17/), Spring Boot 3.x, Lombok, H2, Caffeine Cache, SpringDoc OpenApi 2.x,
  Mapstruct, Liquibase
- Run: `mvn spring-boot:run` in root directory.

[REST API documentation](http://localhost:8080/)  
Credentials:

```
User:  user@yandex.ru / password
Admin: admin@gmail.com / admin
Guest: guest@gmail.com / guest
```

Access to the use of business logic is based on established user roles (ROLE_ADMIN or ROLE_USER).

1. Administrators (ROLE_ADMIN) can add restaurants and daily menus:

- An administrator can create a new restaurant by sending a
  POST request to the endpoint /api/admin/restaurants.
- An administrator can create a new menu for a restaurant by sending a
  POST request to the endpoint /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/menus.

2. Users (ROLE_USER) can vote for the restaurant where they want to have lunch today:

- A user can vote for a restaurant by sending a
  POST request to the endpoint /api/votes.
- The vote includes the user and restaurant IDs.
- A user can only vote once a day (only the last vote is counted).
- If a user votes again on the same day before 11:00,
  it is considered that they changed their mind and the last vote replaces the previous one.

3. Each restaurant provides a new menu every day:

- An administrator can create/update the daily menu for a restaurant by sending a
  PUT request to the endpoint /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/menus/{menuId}.
- An administrator can delete the daily menu for a restaurant by sending a
  DELETE request to the endpoint /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/menus/{menuId}.

4. If a user votes again on the same day after 11:00, the vote cannot be changed:

- The application checks the time when the user submits a new vote request.
- If the time is after 11:00, the application rejects the new vote request.
